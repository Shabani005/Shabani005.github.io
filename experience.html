            <h2>
                Python Programming
            </h2>
            <p>
                Decent knowledge of python, used mainly for data science and machine learning stuff. But I had fun building wrappers for C libraries with it.

            <h2>
                C Programming
            </h2>
            <p>
                Mainly using it to for hobby projects because I find low level programming very fascinating. (including graphics and compilers etc)
            </p>
            <h2>
                R Programming
            </h2>
            <p>
                Used for simple data analysis and visualization that I know will work, because R studio has many stuff built in for users.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Tableau
            </h2>
            <p>
                Used along Tableau prep to clean and visualize data to make dashboards that give good insights.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Golang
            </h2>
            <p>
                Not an expert, but its such a nice and simple language (in terms of philosophy), I fall in love with it again every time I use it.
